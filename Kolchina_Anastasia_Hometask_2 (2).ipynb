An expert on returning to work, Carol Fishman Cohen, believes you shouldn\\'t neglect them. In this presentation, you will hear about her own experience of returning to work as a 40-year-old intern, her activities to advocate for the interests of the \"second-timers\" and how employers are reconsidering their approach to returning talent.', 'Carol Fishman Cohen: How to get back to work after a break', 'Tim Urban knows there\\'s nothing good about procrastination, but he\\'s never been able to get rid of the habit of putting things back on track. In his amusing and instructive performance, Urban takes us on a trip to see YouTube video bouncing, \"inflammation\" on Wikipedia, and the onset of unbroken surveillance of the window, encouraging us to think carefully about what we\\'re really putting on hold, until it\\'s too late.', \"Tim Urban: What's going on in the head of a long-standing procrastinate?\", 'Uber did not begin with great ambition and desire to reduce congestion and environmental emissions. But when the project was successful, the founder of Travis Kalanick wondered if it would be possible for Uber users to travel along the same routes together in the same car, thus reducing CO2 emissions and reducing the price. As a result, the UberPOL machine-sharing service became available, which in the first eight months saved almost 13 million kilometres and reduced emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 1,400 tons, only in Los Angeles. Kalanick now claims that common cars can also work in the suburbs. \"With the technologies that are already in our pockets, and with reasonable laws, we can make every machine common and start improving cities today,\" he says.', 'Travis Kalanick: How Uber is going to place more people in fewer cars', 'A textile artist, Magda Sayeg, turns urban landscapes into her own playground, decorated objects with paintings bound by sticks or hooks. These warm, fuzzy yarn explosions began with small pillars with the sign \"STOP\" and fire hydrants in Saig\\'s home town, but soon people saw the real art in it and spread it around the world. \"We all live in this fast-growing digital world, but we still want something cozy and close,\" Sayeg says. \"Hidden power can be found in the least visible places, and we all have skills that only expect us to discover them.\"', 'Magda Sayeg: How street knitting has grown into a worldwide movement', 'The curling seaskates, the fast dolphins, the huge fish joints, and the squeezing sharks are a whole world hidden beneath the surface of the ocean, only a few can see.
